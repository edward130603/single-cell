# single-cell

MAST_TSEA.R and log_reg.R are my initial scripts for running MAST and logistic regression with the Guo 2015 data (Jul/Aug ppts).

The sim_method_compare.R includes code for each of the methods I compared using the simulated data (Aug/Sep ppt).

The python script runs a loop to get the results for several permutations (Aug ppt).

The GSE64016 files are the scripts for running the methods with the Leng 2016 data (Sep ppt).
